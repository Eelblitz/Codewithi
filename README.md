About

This repository contains a single-page portfolio (index.html) that highlights professional roles: Website Designer, UI/UX Designer, Software Engineer, and Data Analyst. The page is a static HTML file with inline styles and a small script to switch sections.

Site structure

- Home — Introduction and summary
- About — Personal statement and working approach
- Skills — Lists technical and design skills (HTML, CSS, JS, Python, R, UI/UX, WordPress, DB management, Data analysis)
- Services — Offered services (design, custom development, business websites, maintenance, UI/UX improvements)
- Projects — Example project cards
- Testimonials — Short client quotes
- Contact — Phone and email; includes a static contact form (static page only — form needs a backend or form service to send messages)

Usage

1. View locally

- Open index.html in any modern browser.

2. Deploy with GitHub Pages

- Commit this README.md and the existing index.html to the main branch.
- In the repository, go to Settings → Pages (or Settings → Code and automation → Pages).
- Choose Branch: main and Folder: / (root) and Save.
- Wait a minute and visit: https://Eelblitz.github.io/Codewithi

3. Alternative: place index.html inside a docs/ folder and set Pages source to main / docs.

Customization

- Edit the content in index.html to update name, contact details, and project descriptions.
- Replace placeholder project cards with real screenshots and links (add images into an assets/ folder and reference them from the HTML).
- To make the contact form send messages, integrate a service like Formspree, Getform, or add a backend endpoint and change the form action accordingly.
- If you prefer a multi-file or framework-based site (React, Vue, etc.), build to a static output and publish to the docs/ folder or use a gh-pages branch or Actions.
